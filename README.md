Using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics the following issues were identified:

1.	Visibility of System Status – Users are unaware of any stages - e.g when items are added to the basket
2.	Match between the system and the real world – Most terminology is consistent with real world, however it is difficult to find products. No sort options.
3.	User Control and Freedom – Users cannot remove items at checkout
4.	Consistency and Standards – Design is not consistent across pages. There is no clear branding to the page.
5.	Error Prevention – No error messages, or guidance. Users have to input information each time they order - can lead to errors.
6.	Recognition rather than recall – Overall steps are clear however Users have to input information each time they order. it is not clear what some buttons do.
7.	Flexibility and Efficiency of Use – Users have no way of tailoring their experience.
8.	Aesthetics and Minimalist Design – UI is not minimal. There is no way of closing cookies.
9.	Help Users to Recognise, Diagnose and Recover from Errors- No error messages.
10.	Help and Documentation – No help or documentation.

**These issues are fixed in the following designs:**

Example feedback:

‘The overall layout is quite clear on some pages, Text is harder to read in areas where text is small (participant is talking regarding the about, contact). I am unable to see what products there are in the basket without going to the basket page and once my order is placed there is no confirmation'

‘I like the website design and color palette; it is visually pleasing! But I could not see the price well because it has the same font size as the amount number. I think it is better to increase the pricing font size a bit bigger than the amount number. Another thing, I think you can add icons next to product names to indicate top-selling items such as trending or best-selling. It would help users to know which items are most popular.’ 

Areas identified executed well:
- pleasant layout
- clear navigation
- intuitive interface
- harmonious colour scheme
- consistency and clear branding colours
- convenience in services

Areas identified for improvement:
- Post order tracking
- Font sizes/types
- Quick view of basket
- Item removal features i.e. remove all items of type from basket
- Popular/Sale item indicators
- Wishlist features
- Click and collect options
- Promo-codes
- Payment options
- Continue as Guest option
- Privacy/performance features
